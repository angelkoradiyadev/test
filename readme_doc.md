    *   Relative to the script's directory (project root).
    *   The user's Desktop directory (cross-platform).
    *   The system's temporary directory (`/tmp` on Unix-like, `C:\\Temp` on Windows).
*   **Execution Timeout:** Enforces a maximum duration for the application's runtime. If the specified `timeout_seconds` is exceeded, the application is terminated.
*   **Background Threading:** Utilizes `threading` to run both the kill switch monitoring and timeout enforcement concurrently in daemon threads, allowing the main application to proceed normally while being monitored.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Uses `os` module functions (`os.path.abspath`, `os.path.join`, `os.path.expanduser`, `os.name`) to ensure file path resolution and directory access work correctly across different operating systems.
*   **Immediate Termination:** Employs `os._exit(1)` for immediate and forceful application termination, bypassing normal exit routines to ensure quick shutdown in critical scenarios.
*   **Configurable Parameters:** Allows customization of the kill switch file path and the timeout duration during initialization.
*   **Stop Monitoring Capability:** Provides a `stop_monitoring` method to gracefully signal the background threads to cease their operations, allowing for controlled shutdown of the security features if needed.

### Uses
*   **Sandbox Environments:** Limiting the execution time or providing an emergency stop for code running in a controlled or untrusted environment.
